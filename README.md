Pixel 2D Tactical RPG meets Puzzle Game on Unity, made in the context of my thesis.

This game was entirely designed and developed by Miguel Keim for his masters in Computer Science, taken in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. The thesis centered itself on the adaptation of tutorials based on the individual Working Memory of players, with the potential to find out if different learning methodologies would be better suited for individuals with different learning capabilities.

In order to run it the project, simply download the files and run the Unity executable file.
