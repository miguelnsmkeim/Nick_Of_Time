Pixel 2D Tactical RPG meets Puzzle Game on Unity, made in the context of my thesis.

This game was entirely designed and developed by Miguel Keim for his masters in Computer Science, taken in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

In order to run it, simply download the files and run the Unity executable file.
